Game Guidelines

• Your game must have at least 10 locations or rooms.
 • These locations must be connected to form a maze.
 • You start in Location/Room 1. 
• Each place is connected to from 1 to 4 other places. 
• The connections are referred to by the direction they face (N, S, E, W). 
• When you type in a direction (’N’, ’S’, ’E’, or ’W’), you travel through that connection.
 • When you type in ‘H’, the game will print out a help menu with basic instructions to play.
• Your game must have at least 4 things that the player needs to collect as part of the game.
 • The four things are scattered throughout the maze of locations. 
• All the items must be collected in order. 
• When you enter a room, you automatically collect the thing that is there (assuming you are allowed to collect it) 
• After collecting the 4 parts, your game must require that the player travel somewhere special/do something different. 
• Your game must have a time limit (with something bad happening if the game isn’t won by the end) 
• Each move from one location to the next takes 1 minute but the time it takes you to make a decision on where to go does not count. 
• After finding the 4th item, the game must do something special as the user tries to win it. 
• Every time you enter a location, a message is displayed. The message must include (at a minimum): 1. Where you are 2. Information about any parts in the room 3. Any passages in the room 4. Information about time left (and consequences) 
• If you enter a direction that does not exist, the message “You cannot go there” is displayed and you remain in your current room (with another prompt) - and no time is deducted. • If you enter a command that is not recognized, the message “What are you saying” is displayed and you remain in your current room (with another prompt) - and no time is deducted.
 • At the end of the game, a message states whether you succeeded or failed.
